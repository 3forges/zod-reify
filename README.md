# Zod Reify

The `zod-reify` npm package contains `zod` related utilities that the pesto app uses.

One of the most important, is the `ZodSchemaReifier`, which is able to read some source code provided as a simple string, and to instantiate a zod schema.

* left TODO before a first release:

I have now the generalized algorithm:

* [ ] we need to add more test cases to fully cover all zod functions support.
* [ ] We also need to update docs and README. We also need to change the git repository.
* [x] We also need to complete method renaming.
* [ ] We also need to replace any `console.log` with winston logging silenced by default.
* [ ] setup the cloudflare pages to publish the documentation astro website

Finally adding some speed automated tests with <https://github.com/tinylibs/tinybench>

Jest Tests reporting:

* [x] so i will use the Junit reporter:
* [x] and convert it to JSON, to be used by astro, with: <https://github.com/Kesin11/ts-junit2json>
* [ ] a good layout for the tests report page.

## How to Use

* first, install the package:

```bash
npm i @pesto-io/zod-reify
# pnpm add @pesto-io/zod-reify
```

* Then, in your code, you can:

```TypeScript
import { ZodSchemaReifier } from "@pesto-io/zod-reify"


```

## Contribute

Git clone the source, and:

* Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Generate the docs

```bash
pnpm run gen:api-docs
```

#### The Astro docs (WIP)

```bash
pnpm run build:docs:astro
# pnpm run dev:docs:astro

```

## ANNEX: The next Evolution

### Evaluate typescript from string

* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45153848/evaluate-typescript-from-string>

```Ts
import * as ts from "typescript";

let code: string = `({
    Run: (data: string): string => {
        console.log(data); return Promise.resolve("SUCCESS"); }
    })`;

let result = ts.transpile(code);
let runnable :any = eval(result);
runnable.Run("RUN!").then((result:string)=>{console.log(result);});
```
